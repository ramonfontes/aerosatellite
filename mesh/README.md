# Satellite-to-Satellite Communication

In this use case, the emulation framework was extended to investigate satellite-to-satellite communication, focusing on
the interactions within a low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation. The primary goal of this experiment was to evaluate the
emulator’s ability to model dynamic orbital behavior and inter-satellite connectivity within a realistic mesh topology.
