# Video Streaming

In this use case, the emulation framework was extended to investigate satellite-to-ground video transmission, showcasing
the system’s capability to support high-bandwidth and time-sensitive multimedia data flows. This scenario is particularly
relevant for next-generation satellite networks, where video streams play a critical role in remote sensing, environmental
monitoring, disaster assessment, and real-time situational awareness.
