# Use Cases

## [Traffic Collision Avoidance System](tcas/README.md)

This use case explores the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) functionality. The aircraft positions used in this
experiment were obtained from real flight data of aircraft operating near Lisbon Airport (LPPT), Portugal.

## [Aircraft Surveillance](adsb/README.md)

In this use case, we demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed emulation framework in reproducing realistic Aircraft-to-
Ground (A2G) communication scenarios. To that end, we employed the Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast
(ADS-B) protocol to emulate aircraft telemetry and surveillance behavior. 


## [Space Networking System](mesh/README.md)

In this use case, the emulation framework was extended to investigate satellite-to-satellite communication, focusing on
the interactions within a low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation. The primary goal of this experiment was to evaluate the
emulator’s ability to model dynamic orbital behavior and inter-satellite connectivity within a realistic mesh topology.


## [Video Streaming](video/README.md)

In this use case, the emulation framework was extended to investigate satellite-to-ground video transmission, showcasing
the system’s capability to support high-bandwidth and time-sensitive multimedia data flows. This scenario is particularly
relevant for next-generation satellite networks, where video streams play a critical role in remote sensing, environmental
monitoring, disaster assessment, and real-time situational awareness.

## [Automatic Dependent Surveillance](adsc/README.md)

This use case illustrates the exchange of surveillance data between an aircraft and a satellite using the ADS-C (Automatic
Dependent Surveillance–Contract) protocol over the ATN/IPS (Aeronautical Telecommunications Network over IP
Suite) communication stack.
